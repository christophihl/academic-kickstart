In September 2022 I joined the Institute for Data Science Foundations (TUHH) by Nihat Ay as a PhD student. Here, I am supervised by Manfred Eppe. Our research focuses on a cognitively inspired attention mechanism to improve transfer learning and adaptive behavior of artificial agents. The research work is conducted as part of the MoReSpace project.
