I am the scientific and administrative manager of the Center for Data and Computing in Natural Sciences (CDCS), a data science collaboration between DESY, the University of Hamburg and TU Hamburg. I lead an interdisciplinary, data science-focused group of 11 postdocs from the fields of astrophysics, particle physics, computer science, photon science, systems biology and accelerator control.

I am particularly interested in topics that combine experimental work and computational analysis (especially statistical models, information theory and computational modelling of e.g. neuron populations). During my Bachelor's, Master's and doctoral projects, I always collected the data to be analysed experimentally and am now familiar with experimental design, sensor networks and many problems of e.g. awake-behaving electrophysiology and data preprocessing.
