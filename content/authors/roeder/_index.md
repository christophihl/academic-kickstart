Before joining the Institute for Data Science Foundations under Prof. Nihat Ay at the Hamburg University of Technology, I was a Ph.D. student at the Knowledge Technology Group led by Prof. Stefan Wermter. Presently, I am working with my supervisors, Dr. Manfred Eppe, on cognitive robotics. Our research focuses on exploring the self through sensorimotor exploration within the MoReSpace project and language grounding for action corrections within the LeCAREbot project.

In addition to my research, I am a member of the Gesellschaft für Informatik (GI).
