After leading international teams of thermo-fluid dynamics experts in larger aerospace/transportation engineering companies (DaimlerChrysler, Bombardier), I was appointed professor at the School of Mechanical Engineering of Hamburg Univ. of Technology University in 2007. 

My research interests comprise flow physics modelling in thermo-fluid dynamics, numerical analysis, simulation-based optimization as well as computational modelling of multi-phase, multi-continua and impact problems using Eulerian, Lagrangian, kinetic and data driven approaches. Emphasis is given to aerospace and marine engineering applications.

I currently serve on several editorial boards and conference organization committees dedicated to thermo-fluid dynamics, aerospace and marine engineering. I am particularly interested in computational engineering and act as the managing director of the scientific and admission board for the North German Super Computer Alliance, which is amongst the biggest super computers installed in Europe.  Moreover, I am keen on bridging the gap between applied mathematics and computational engineering, and am vice-/spokesperson of two related collaborative research training initiatives looking at modelling, simulation, uncertainty quantification and optimization (DFG-RTG2583, SENSUS).
