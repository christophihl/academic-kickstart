Dr. Moritz Braun is the head of the ship reliability department at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) for Maritime Energy Systems in Geesthacht, Germany. He holds a B.Sc. in mechanical engineering (2012), a M.Sc. in Marine Technology (2014) and a Doctor of Engineering (2021). For his doctoral thesis, he received the Curt-Bartsch-Award of the German Society for Maritime Technology. His research is focusing on structural integrity assessment of large engineering structures and in particular on fatigue and fracture mechanics. He is the delegate of the German Association for the German Welding Association (DVS) at the International Institute of Welding (IIW) in ‘Commission XV: Design, Analysis, and Fabrication of Welded Structures’, German representative in the International Ship and Offshore Structures Congress (ISSC) technical committee ‘V.7 Structural Assessment During Operations’, and vice chair of working group ‘Damages of Ship Structures’ of DVS.
