I am a PhD researcher in the Computational Mathematics group under the supervision of Daniel 
Ruprecht and Sebastian Götschel. My primary field of research interest is Artificial 
Intelligence (AI). Within AI, I am interested in problems related to machine learning,
data mining and their interdisciplinary applications to parallel-in-time methods for 
time-dependent PDEs. My current research is exploring machine learning-based 
parallel-in-time methods to solve unsteady nonlinear problems more efficiently. 
The approach is broadly applicable but we consider as an example, the nonlinear 
Black-Scholes equation, which may be used to value financial options and to calculate 
implied volatilities.
