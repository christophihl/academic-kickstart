On September, 25th to 27th, 2023 the third [MLE Days](https://mle-days.hamburg) on machine learning in engineering will take place on the campus of the Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH). This year, it combines a summer school with a one-day startup-challenge. Participation is free of charge, but a [registration](https://mle-days.hamburg/2023/registration.html) is required.

The Summer School teaches insights into the world of machine learning with a focus on engineering. It provides sessions about fundamentals of machine learning, concrete application examples, as well as hands-on sessions to try out and consolidate lessons learned. Keynote talks complete the program. Three parallel tracks are provided to allow participants to choose contributions adapted to their interest and machine learning experience. The use cases range from sensor and image processing, to electrical engineering and materials science, to aviation and maritime logistics. A poster session and an elevator pitch event allow participants to present their own work on machine learning topics. The best posters and pitches will be selected by a jury and awarded prizes. A networking event allows attendees to establish contacts with selected corporate partners and sponsors from start-ups and medium-sized businesses to large corporations. In the startup-challenge attendees learn how to turn machine learning ideas into a business.

The MLE Days are organized by the Machine Learning in Engineering research initiative of the TUHH (MLE@TUHH) in collaboration with the Helmholtz Center Hereon, DASHH, and the Career Center of TUHH, the AI.Startup.Hub, and AI.HAMBURG. The MLE initiative joins the competencies in the field of machine learning at the Hamburg University of Technology with the goal of transferring knowledge towards business and industry. Students, PhD students, postdocs, and professors from all disciplines of the TUHH are engaged together with colleagues from the Helmholtz Center Hereon to make methods and applications of machine learning known, to network, and to foster scientific exchange.

[Join us](https://mle-days.hamburg/2023/registration.html) to discover the new applications of machine learning in engineering practice!

We look forward to welcoming you soon at our Hamburg University of Technology and at MLE Days!
