### HULKs:
We are a team of students from the Hamburg University of Technology. Since the foundation of our team in the year 2013, we are participating anually in the Standard Platform League of the RoboCup competition. The RoboCup is an international initiative with the goal of advancing research in humanoid robotics and artificial intelligence. Our team consists mostly of students who work on this project in their free time. Furthermore, we are one of the few teams that developed their entire framework from scratch.

### RoHOW:
Since 2014, we are anually hosting the Robotic Hamburg Open Workshop (RoHOW).

The RoHOW is an event hosted by the Hamburg University of Technology that serves the purpose of education and networking. Over 100 scientists and students from all over the world who are researching in the field of humanoid robotics participate in this event.

The goal of this event is the exchange of information between RoboCup teams from different universities and research institutes. Participants have the opportunity to visit lectures and workshops, challenge other teams in competitions, and get in direct contact with each other.

Here you find more information on [RoHOW](https://rohow.de).
